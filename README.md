# 100Days-Python-Course
This is my repository for the projects and assignments in Angela Yu's Udemy course - 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2022

Based on the quiz, I started on Day 15 Intermediate
Many of the project days are 
<ul>
<li><em>Day 15</em> - Coffee Machine. For some reason, even though the specification said we were to ask for quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies, the assignment did not ask to have the machine keep track of these quantities. I spent more than a day on this project.</li>
<li><em>Day 16</em> - Continued working on Coffee Machine. Created a money machine class (to keep track of the register) and a coffee maker class with different objects for coffee types. No need to create a new object each time an espresso is requested. Use a singleton for each type of coffee. </li> 
<li><em>Day 17</em> - Beginning tutorial on how Python classes and objects work. The __init__ constructor method. QuizBrain app.</li> 
<li><em>Day 18</em> - Beginning a section on turtle graphics. The kind of simplistic crap that always turned me off instructional books and tutorials. For some reason, I still worked through it.</li> 
<li><em>Day 19</em> - More Turtle. Turtle race and etch-a-sketch.</li> 
<li><em>Day 20-21</em> - More Turtle, but this turtle comes as a snake. The snake_game. A bit more fun. Some interesting problems to work through.</li> 
<li><em>Day 22</em> - pong. Whatever happened to Pong? You better believe I was listening to Frank Black and the Pixies while working on this.</li> 
<li><em>Day 23</em> - turtle-crossing. Like frogger. Caroline thought it was cute.</li>
<li><em>Day 24</em> - Modified the snake game to persist scores.The day24 folder has nothing - everything in snake_game.</li>
<li><em>Day 25</em> - Pandas. perform queries on 2018 squirrel census data.</li>
<li><em>Day 26</em> - NATO-alphabet. list comprehensions and pandas.</li>
<li><em>Day 27</em> - tkinter. All the most horrible things about any gui ever. ugh.</li>
<li><em>Day 28</em> - pomodoro. More tkinter.</li>
<li><em>Day 29-30</em> - password-manager. More tkinter. add json.</li>
<li><em>Day 31</em> - flash-card app. More tkinter</li>
<li><em>Day 32</em> - Birthday-Wisher. Sends a random mail-merged birthday email to contacts</li>
<li><em>Day 33</em> - issoverhead space station notifier. Using apis. I started to use separate config files, here a config.py.</li>
<li><em>Day 34</em> - quizzler-app. Using trivia apis and putting on tkinter quiz app. Started to use toml as a better config loader.</li>
<li><em>Day 35</em> - rain_alert. Use openweather api and twilio app to text a rain alert.</li>
<li><em>Day 36</em> - stock-news app. Another api and json nav. Send texts with twilio. Started from extrahard. Like bragging about tying my shoes all by myself.</li>
<li><em>Day 37</em> - habit-tracker. More apis. HTTP Header authentication.</li>
<li><em>Day 38</em> - workout-tracker. More apis, using google sheet.</li>
<li><em>Day 39-40</em> - flight deals. Use Kiwi, google sheets, twilio, email.</li>
<li><em>Day 41-44</em> - web-foundation. html & css basic tutorials. A silly static page published to pages at https://noah-clements.github.io/100-Days-site/.
<li> add when you have time</li>
<li> etc </li>
<li><em>Day 62</em> - Coffee & Wifi. Using Bootstrap quickforms WTForms Flask-WTF, and extending the bootstrap/base.html and overloading the css. Was going to use a csv.DictWriter for the WTForm, but the csv did not have an ending "\n", so would continue the last line on the first add. I would have thought that was the point of adding keys to the DictWriter (so it could place values in the correct column), but this is not a panda. Did what the class solution suggested, no need to use csv class to write with a ",".join. Continuing using Selenium based unittests a la TDD.</li>
<li><em>Day 63</em> - 
</ul>
